\item  {\bf Combinatoric factor for external field $S$-matrix} [2 points]

Explain the origin of the combinatoric factor when applying Wick's theorem to an interaction with an external source. 

\item {\bf Unitarity of the $S$-matrix for an external field} [3 points]

Show that the $S$-matrix calculated in class is unitary, that is 
\[ 1 = \sum_n |\langle n|S|0\rangle |^2, \]
where the $\left\{|n\rangle\right\} $ is the set of all possible $n$-particle intermediate states.

\item{\bf Quadratic external field} [15 points]

Consider an interaction Hamiltonian in the presence of an external c-number source as in class, except now assume that the perturbation is quadratic in the field,
$$ H'= \frac{1}{2} \lambda \left[ \int d^3x \rho (\vec{x}) \phi (\vec{x},t)\right]^2,$$
where $\lambda$ is a positive coupling constant and $\rho (\vec{x})$ is a real function of spatial position. Compute the matrix elements $\langle \vec{k}'|S-1|\vec{k}\rangle$ for the scattering between (non-relativistically normalized) one-particle states by summing  connected Wick diagrams. Explicitly verify that the one-particle to one-particle $S$-matrix is unitary. 

%Hints: (1) As discussed in class, you don't need to worry about the disconnected diagrams. (2) Every vertex in a Wick diagram represents a seven dimensional integral: two three-dimensional spatial integrals and one time integral. (3) Don't get carried away by trying to prove mathematical niceties: assume power series converge, $\rho$ is sufficiently smooth and falls of sufficiently rapidly, etc. (4) The final answer involves a single three dimensional integral over momenta involving $\tilde{\rho}(\vec{k})$. Don't try to further simplify it. However if your answer involves more complicated objects you should try to get it to this form.

\item  {\bf Symmetry factors done honestly} [9 points]

Calculate the symmetry factors for the following \textit{Wick} diagrams `honestly,' that is, expand to the appropriate power of the interaction Hamiltonian and explicitly state all combinatorial factors:

Assume the interaction terms take the form $\mathcal L_I = \frac{\lambda_3}{3!} \phi^3 + \frac{\lambda_4}{4!} \phi^4$.
Convince yourself that you get the same results if you work out the symmetry factors the `slick' way. \textit{Hint}: follow the method presented in class since many textbooks define symmetry factors differently (e.g.\ for Wick versus Feynman diagrams).

\item  {\bf American Gothic} [1 point]

Determine the symmetry factor of the following Wick diagram based on Grant Wood's \textit{American Gothic}. Assume that the interaction Lagrangian takes the form $\mathcal{L} =\sum_n \frac{\lambda_n}{n!} \phi^n$.
Black dots (eyes) are purely decorative. \textit{Hint}: go ahead and do this the slick way. It helps to simplify the diagram to one that is topologically equivalent.
